I am learning Python on my own. I have taken the free course in Udemy, The Art of Doing: Code 40 Challenging Python Programs Today. To be honest this will be usefull only for the beginer who have just started to learn python.I think if you know the basic you can easily solve those 40 problems (might not be challenging oppss!!). I have attached the solution for every problem. Hope it will be of great use to practice for the beginer.

Here is the screenshot of my certificate:
